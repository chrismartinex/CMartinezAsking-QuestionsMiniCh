//re created the program from the original one, this time around I added a boolean. The program kicks you out, when you wish to not play no more., 
and it also allows you to replay when you choose yes., a step up from the original program i had. The last added feature is the Validation to the program.


Peer Review by Daniel Decoito: The app is good and runs well. Everything works well and the end result meets the assignment criteria. You can work on simplifying your code tho. Start with the mechansims to end the while loop to terminate the game. I suggest switching it to a string statment and using a not equal to (!=) as the condition. It will help to get rid of the else statment at the end and simplify your code. Also try to utilize string interplotion to clean up your code.
